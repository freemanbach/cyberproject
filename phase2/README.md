### Phase I

#### Task1

* The topic on task 1 is to build a custom binary file to hide some important data 
into this binary file. You can choose to use any system-level programming languages 
such as C/C++/Go/RUST/V/NIM/C#. The text in which you must hide will be
https://sites.radford.edu/~flo/index.php

* You can certainly find a optimal method to hide that entire string as a single piece of
data or break it up into multiple chunks. You can certainly look this up on google to see
what might be a best approach is hiding data inside a binary file to be run on windows. 


* Please check out [Task1](https://github.com/freemanbach/cyberproject/blob/main/phase1/task1) documentation. 


### Phase II

#### Task2

* The topic on task 2 is to build a php webpage which will allow two independently discussed
vocabularies to be encrypted in such a manner that --an user-- of this application would
then need to figure out a method to decrypt these two words using a web langauge of choice.

* The design of this single php webpage can either be elegant or simplistic. The basic requirements
are to have a background image as one of the hints as a theme to each of the encrypted words. Both decrypted
words must be encrypted all in lowercase and decrypted as such as well. We can also by keeping track of the
time in which --an user-- spend on that webpage. Once a limit has been set in place and the liit is over,
we could have a header() to referr the --user-- to another page.This can be done using cookie and/or session.

* so, the final goal will be once the correct decrypted value have been found,we would immediately a link to download
a binary file to be solved on the next phase. i have yet to decide as to what but we can discuss this in class.
