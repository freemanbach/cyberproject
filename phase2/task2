#### Task2

* The topic on task 2 is to build a php webpage which will allow two independently discussed 
vocabularies to be encrypted in such a manner that --an user-- of this application would 
then need to figure out a method to decrypt these two words using a web langauge of choice.

* The design of this single php webpage can either be elegant or simplistic. The basic requirements
are to have a background image as one of the hints as a theme to each of the encrypted words. Both decrypted
words must be encrypted all in lowercase and decrypted as such as well. We can also by keeping track of the 
time in which --an user-- spend on that webpage. Once a limit has been set in place and the liit is over,
we could have a header() to referr the --user-- to another page.This can be done using cookie and/or session. 

* so, the final goal will be once the correct decrypted value have been found,we would immediately a link to download
a binary file to be solved on the next phase. i have yet to decide as to what but we can discuss this in class.
