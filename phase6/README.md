### Phase I

#### Task1

* The topic on task 1 is to build a custom binary file to hide some important data 
into this binary file. You can choose to use any system-level programming languages 
such as C/C++/Go/RUST/V/NIM/C#. The text in which you must hide will be
https://sites.radford.edu/~flo/index.php

* You can certainly find a optimal method to hide that entire string as a single piece of
data or break it up into multiple chunks. You can certainly look this up on google to see
what might be a best approach is hiding data inside a binary file to be run on windows. 


* Please check out [Task1](https://github.com/freemanbach/cyberproject/blob/main/phase1/task1) documentation. 


### Phase II

#### Task2

* The topic on task 2 is to build a php webpage which will allow two independently discussed
vocabularies to be encrypted in such a manner that --an user-- of this application would
then need to figure out a method to decrypt these two words using a web langauge of choice.

* The design of this single php webpage can either be elegant or simplistic. The basic requirements
are to have a background image as one of the hints as a theme to each of the encrypted words. Both decrypted
words must be encrypted all in lowercase and decrypted as such as well. We can also by keeping track of the
time in which --an user-- spend on that webpage. Once a limit has been set in place and the liit is over,
we could have a header() to referr the --user-- to another page.This can be done using cookie and/or session.

* so, the final goal will be once the correct decrypted value have been found,we would immediately provide a link to download
a binary file to be solved on the next phase. i have yet to decide as to what but we can discuss this in class.


* Plese check out [Task2](https://github.com/freemanbach/cyberproject/blob/main/phase2/task2) documentation.

### Phase III

#### Task3

* The topic on task 3 is to build a system application using any system language of your choosing. This can be
go/rust/C/C++/V/Nim. We had discussed that there needs to be an algorithm used in this binary code, which will be unlocked
by an user. The algorithm at which can be used shall be of mathematical type. Fee Free to research a basic 
Math Algorithm to hide this one word passcode for the next phase, Phase IV.

* The design of this single php webpage can either be elegant or simplistic. The basic requirements
are to have a special passcode to be mathematically encrypted as a puzzel. The user of this binary file will
need to decrypt it in order to find the real passcode to unlock the next phase. We could also hide a string inside this binary file
for the user to find its website as well. 

* so, the final goal will be once the correct decrypted value have been found, we will show the next phase via a link
inside this binary file. 

* Plese check out [Task3](https://github.com/freemanbach/cyberproject/blob/main/phase3/task3) documentation.


### Phase IV

#### Task4

* The topic on task 4 is to build a Image Stagenography file to allow an user to enter a password before 
the image can be viewed. 

* I will demonstrate this during class on how easily this be done.

* Plese check out [Task4](https://github.com/freemanbach/cyberproject/blob/main/phase4/task4) documentation.
