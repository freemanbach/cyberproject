#### Task3

* The topic on task 3 is to build a system application using any system language of your choosing. This can be
go/rust/C/C++/V/Nim. We had discussed that there needs to be an algorithm used in this binary code, which will be unlocked
by an user. The algorithm at which can be used shall be of mathematical type. Fee Free to research a basic 
Math Algorithm to hide this one word passcode for the next phase, Phase IV.

* The design of this single php webpage can either be elegant or simplistic. The basic requirements
are to have a special passcode to be mathematically encrypted as a puzzel. The user of this binary file will
need to decrypt it in order to find the real passcode to unlock the next phase. We could also hide a string inside this binary file
for the user to find its website as well. 

* so, the final goal will be once the correct decrypted value have been found, we will show the next phase via a link
inside this binary file. 

* Plese check out [Task3](https://github.com/freemanbach/cyberproject/blob/main/phase3/task3) documentation.
